    <h1>Salt and Straw Ice Cream</h1>
    <p>My favorite ice cream base recipe. Easy, fast, no eggs, no custard, takes mixins/flavors well. Don't skip the xanthan gum-- it really maximizes the smoothness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>115g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>15g dry milk powder</li>
        <li>1g xanthan gum</li>
        <li>40g light corn syrup</li>
        <li>330g whole milk</li>
        <li>330g heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients and mix well</li>
        <li>Combine the corn syrup and milk in a pot.</li> 
        <li>Add the sugar mixture and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
        <li>Set the pot over medium heat and cook until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Stir often and adjust heat to avoid a simmer.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and add the cream. Whisk until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Store mixture in an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours but ideally at least 24.</li>
        <li>Churn chilled ice cream base according to your ice cream maker's directions.</li>
    </ol>
