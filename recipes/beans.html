    <h1>Beans</h1>
    <p>Foolproof method for preparing dry beans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High quality</strong> dry beans. <a href="https://www.ranchogordo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="external">Rancho Gordo</a> brand or similar</li>
        <li>Aromatics! Onion, garlic, celery, carrot, peppers, whatever you want</li>
        <li>Oil or butter to fry your aromatics</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Whatever flavorings you want. Spices, bullion, dried mushroom powder, the sky's the limit</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Optionally soak the beans in salted water for up to six hours before cooking.</li>
        <li>In a pot large enough to hold the beans, fry your aromatics in your choice of oil.</li>
        <li>When the aromatics are softened, add the beans and enough water to cover them by a couple of inches.</li>
        <li>Bring the beans to a rolling boil and boil them hard for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the beans to as low a simmer as possible and cook until tender, several hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Add your flavorings whenever seems appropriate. Things like boullion and bay leaves when you start to boil the beans, things like fresh herbs at the end.</p>
    <p>Keep at least an inch of water above the beans at all times lest they scorch. If you need to add more water, boil water in a separate vessel and add that.</p>
